# TODO

* Write some predicates: (is-string), (is-number), (is-null), (is-undefined), etc
* Write macros: (if), (when), (or), (and)
* Figure out a better place to put all the library functions and macros
* Do lambda unit tests
* Make a Cons class for sexp's (instead of using Array)
	* Write related functions: (first), (rest), (second), (third), (last)
	* OR: (car), (cdr), (caar), (cadr), (caaar), etc
* Parse comments
* Think about writing the unit tests for the lisp functions in lisp (would be a good example)
* Make a webpage at the root of /src that runs on `rake run`
	* This webpage should link off to the test runner(s) and all examples
	* As a demonstration, all the interactions of this page should be written in lisp
* Think about how to get line numbers for lisp scripts for debugging
